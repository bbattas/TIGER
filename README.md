<b>TIGER</b>

TIGER is a Python module for directly accessing Exodus and Nemesis file data as numpy arrays. Examples demonstrate how to generate high quality figures using matplotlib and the TIGER interface.

I have also been using this as a repository for some useful miscellaneous scripts to pass them across devices/locations.
