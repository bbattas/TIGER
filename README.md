#TIGER
A Python module for directly accessing Exodus and Nemesis file data as numpy arrays. I have also provided example scripts for plotting 1D, 2D and 3D exodus files. 

Requires the following Python modules be installed: matplotlib numpy scipy h5py netcdf4
You can install them by running: pip install matplotlib numpy scipy h5py netcdf4

Importing this module in Python scripts requires TIGER to be added to your PYTHONPATH, or you can copy ExodusReader.py and MultiExodusReader.py into the working directory.
